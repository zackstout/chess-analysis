# Analyzing Chess Games
I stumbled upon this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) of previously-played chess games. My first idea is to build a tree of possible openings and variations.

I didn't include the CSV in this repository; you'll need to download the data on your own and add it to this project (it should be called `games.csv`).
